# Leakage Model Repository
This repository incubates the whole system of plastic leakage modelling tools to calculate the amount of plastic in the open environment at the city level.

## Integration with Mobile-app
Plastic leakage depends on the survey analysis. See [Mobile Application for Macroplastic Survey](https://arcg.is/1rSHDm) here.
